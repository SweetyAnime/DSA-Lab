SLICING:
Similar to Python lists, numpy arrays can be sliced. Since arrays may be multidimensional, we must specify a slice for each dimension of the array.

AIM:
Write a Python Program to Perform Array Slicing.

ALGORITHM:
Step1: Start
Step2: import numpy module
Step3: Create an array and apply the slicing operator 
Step4: Print the output
Step5: Stop

PROGRAM:
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[4,5,6]])
print(a)
print("After slicing") print(a[1:])

OUTPUT:
[[123]
[34 5]
[456]]
After slicing [345][456]]

RESULT:
Thus the python program to perform array slicing has been implemented and executed successfully.
